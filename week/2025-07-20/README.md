_Small, focused web apps evolve to sharpen creativity and memory with slick UI improvements and fresh ideas._

- **Brand-new Recall tool added:** Introduced a simple, markdown-based spaced repetition viewer called Recall ([c906d6d](https://github.com/sanand0/tools/commit/c906d6d04200d0858daab44adda785d37350c852)). It randomly picks bullets from learning notes using exponential decay weighting to remind you of older ideas more often. Takeaway: Spaced recall done lightweight and browser-friendly keeps knowledge fresh without bloat.
- **Recall mobile usability improved:** Tweaked Recall's layout and controls for smaller screens by refining Bootstrap classes and making the page title clickable for item shuffling ([ce1c919](https://github.com/sanand0/tools/commit/ce1c919e813e5ac97ca9b8abf5f456bb2d078e15)). Takeaway: Small UX polish can make an educational tool truly easy to use anywhere.
- **Daydream ideas viewer enhanced:** Upgraded the app that displays creative AI-generated concepts with fuzzy search, sorting, inspectable ratings, and tooltip explanations ([8a826ef](https://github.com/sanand0/tools/commit/8a826efcc3f882e87360a37577137fce61a9e13e), [90c621b](https://github.com/sanand0/tools/commit/90c621bd02ea97eacaf3d6e0b9ad67d94a79cd54)). Now it supports full text search across multiple fields and intuitive clickable navigation. Takeaway: Enrich interactive data views with search and sorting for deeper exploration.
- **Consistent tool catalog updates:** Added Recall and Daydream apps with icons and descriptions reflecting their creative and mnemonic powers in `tools.json` and README, making them discoverable ([47725fa](https://github.com/sanand0/tools/commit/47725fa3b10313b3e6140acee2f1f461b002e3f8)). Takeaway: Keep your tool index tidy—documentation is your user's best friend.

Yes, you really needed another Fish abbr. But hey, Recall's spaced repetition beats a flashcard deck any day.

### [sanand0/scripts](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts)

_Command-line wizardry advances with robust spaced recall and AI daydream generation to boost brainstorming and memory._

It now collects multiple concept texts and injects a well-structured prompt into the LLM. Takeaway: Giving the AI clearer instructions leads to richer, more relevant creativity.
- **Recall script now includes notes about people:** The markdown note recall tool was updated to scan an additional `Dropbox/notes/about` directory, increasing the breadth of knowledge available for spaced review ([54a4864](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/54a4864b20e104341653149294bd0a58628a4d0e)). Takeaway: Extend your knowledge corpus thoughtfully to capture all relevant fragments.
- **Simplified usage for recall and aligned with Glow:** Changed recall to a standalone script runnable as `recall.js | glow` without flags, streamlining daily usage ([e09469e](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/e09469e1e2cdbc61f8ac2c09b5aa735a109e959f)). Takeaway: Make your daily tools low-friction to build habits.
- **Added lazily loading lazygit setup:** Documented setup for `lazygit` CLI tool in Linux environment with a recommended video walkthrough ([f80ff3d](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/f80ff3da8493bfb04cd4d5db48effadd434f92fe)).
