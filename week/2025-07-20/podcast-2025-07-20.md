Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of 20 Jul 2025!

Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, and today we’ve got some exciting updates on Anand’s projects that mix AI, data, and handy tools.

Alex: Let’s dive right in! First up, we’re exploring some fresh updates in a collection of handy little web apps mostly crafted by language models.

Maya: The big highlight this week is a new tool called Recall. It’s designed to help you with spaced repetition using your own Markdown notes.

Alex: Interesting! So, how does Recall work exactly?

Maya: It pulls list items from Markdown files and uses an exponentially decaying probability to pick what you review next.

Alex: That sounds like a smart way to keep important stuff fresh without overwhelming yourself. Why does the decay factor matter?

Maya: It ensures newer notes appear more often, while older ones gradually fade, optimizing your memory retention over time.

Alex: What about the user interface?

Maya: Recall’s UI got a makeover to work smoothly on mobile – neat controls, smaller buttons, and even a clickable title that picks a new item.

Alex: The fact that it uses Markdown files means it’s super flexible for users to maintain their own note collection.

Maya: Exactly, and it integrates with Anand’s extensive notes like those from things learned or large language model notebooks.

Alex: Cool! Now, also in the same suite, there’s an upgrade to an app named Daydream.

Maya: Yes! Daydream lets you browse creative ideas generated by AI, mixing concepts and goals into radical new proposals.

Alex: I saw that the viewer now supports better searching and sorting with fuzzy search. How does it improve the experience?

Maya: It helps you quickly find relevant ideas by keywords or filter by score categories like novelty or feasibility.

Alex: And it got a fresh responsive layout with clearer navigation between idea lists and details.

Maya: Plus, the tool now shows detailed ratings and explanations for each idea’s scores—perfect for deep insight.

Alex: These additions make Daydream much more approachable for exploring and rating AI-generated creative sparks.

Maya: One more thing about the scripts behind these apps—the daydream generator now supports passing in a goal and multiple concepts.

Alex: So you can tailor the generated ideas to specific themes, making it more relevant?

Maya: Yes, it builds a prompt incorporating those goals and concepts to get a richer, focused output from the language model.

Alex: And Recall, on the scripting front, was improved to also include notes from a special folder with personal notes, right?

Maya: Correct! This inclusion broadens the pool of notes for Recall, making it even more comprehensive.

Alex: Switching gears, Anand also added some GitHub workflows around Claude, the AI assistant, for pull request help and code reviews.

Maya: That’s right. The workflows let Claude automatically comment on issues or review code on PRs, helping maintain code quality and consistency.

Alex: It’s like an AI teammate assisting in your developer flow—reducing manual overhead.

Maya: Plus, the setup is well controlled with permissions and customizable prompts to guide Claude’s behavior.

Alex: Finally, for something a bit different, Anand updated a talk on “Goodbye MBA, Hello AI” including video and transcript.

Maya: That talk explores how AI is reshaping the business world and how students can prepare for an AI-driven future.

Alex: All in all, a rich blend of tools, automation, and insights this week.

Maya: Before we wrap, here’s a quick tip related to Recall: Adjusting the decay factor can finely tune how often you see new vs older notes.

Maya: Alex, how would you experiment with that in your own learning?

Alex: I’d start with a small decay to focus on newer ideas but bump it up occasionally to revisit older, foundational concepts—keeps the balance right.

Maya: Great approach! Remember listeners, small tweaks like that can amplify your study effectiveness.

Alex: Also, don’t forget to explore the tooling options that Anand offers. A good tool can speed up your workflow and enhance creativity.

Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.

Alex: See you next time!
