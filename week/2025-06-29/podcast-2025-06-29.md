Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of 29 June 2025!

Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, thrilled to walk you through the latest highlights from Anand’s GitHub commits this week.

Alex: First up, we’re diving into Anand's talks repository, filled with fresh presentations and insights from the VizChitra 2025 data visualization conference.

Maya: This week’s big change is all about turning raw data into compelling visual stories with Large Language Models, or LLMs.

Alex: Anand added detailed slides and transcripts for his “Prompt to Plot” workshop, showing how to use LLMs to craft beautiful data visualizations, even for mixed audiences.

Maya: What’s fascinating is the hands-on approach — finding datasets, ideating analysis, generating visualizations, and publishing everything online — all driven by AI prompts.

Alex: Right, and he even layered in tactics like giving up quickly if something doesn’t work and moving on, which is a fresh take on coding by AI.

Maya: That reminds me — how does this help someone who isn’t a data expert?

Alex: Great question! The idea is that you don’t need deep coding skills anymore. You basically talk to the AI, it writes the code, and you get a finished visualization.

Maya: So it's democratizing data storytelling. I love how Anand included QR codes for easy access to workshop resources too.

Alex: Next, we have a new data visualization project called BooksViz, showcasing analysis of the Goodreads 100K books dataset.

Maya: Yes! This is exciting — Anand created an interactive scatter plot visualization powered entirely by LLM-generated code.

Alex: He didn’t just stop at making pretty charts, though. The updates refined the article layout into a full-fledged data story, with clear text, key findings, and methodology.

Maya: And the data handling got smarter — filtering out outliers, sampling the data for quick loading, and adding interactive tooltips that explain each data point.

Alex: I found the Python preprocessing script especially neat. It trims out extreme values to focus on meaningful trends and generates a lightweight JSON file for the web.

Maya: A practical trick for anyone dealing with big data visuals — you want to load a manageable subset that tells the real story without lag.

Alex: To wrap up the visualization updates, the D3.js charts now have smooth trendlines and improved aesthetics with custom fonts and color themes, making the whole experience lively and accessible.

Maya: It’s like turning raw numbers into a narrative that anyone can understand and explore interactively.

Alex: Moving on, Anand also polished his personal notes repository where he chronicles things learned weekly.

Maya: He switched from using LLM Foundry to directly integrating OpenAI, which should streamline embedding calculations and similarity scoring in his “Things I learned” process.

Alex: That means enhanced efficiency and control when tagging topics or finding related notes – making his personal knowledge base smarter.

Maya: Plus there’s better error handling and automated formatting on updates, keeping those notes neat and reliable.

Alex: Another neat update was improving various little web tools like Excel to JSONL converters and Markdown to CSV utilities.

Maya: Did you notice the universal switch to using native clipboard API calls? That modernizes these tools and avoids older, unreliable commands.

Alex: Right, making interactions smoother and more compatible across browsers.

Maya: Also, more robust test cases and linting with oxlint improve code quality, making these handy apps more dependable.

Alex: Finally, in his dark theme toggle library for Bootstrap, Anand simplified integration by letting users add a small placeholder div to activate the toggle automatically.

Maya: That’s a usability win — no more copy-pasting large toggling HTML. Just drop a div with a specific class in your navbar, and the dark mode toggle appears.

Alex: Plus, they updated the CDN usage, so you can just link to a shorter URL to get the full functionality immediately.

Maya: It’s all about lowering friction for developers to add modern features like theme switching, improving the user experience with minimal effort.

Alex: Wow, so many fresh improvements that make data, UI, and personal knowledge work better and smarter.

Maya: Before we go, here’s a quick tip inspired by the chat analysis tools Anand’s explored: If you work with lots of chatbot sessions, try clustering similar queries to spot common topics or pain points.

Maya: Alex, how would you use that?

Alex: I’d integrate clustering outputs with dashboards that visualize trends over time, helping prioritize fixes and new features based on what users repeatedly ask.

Maya: Nice! That adds a smart feedback loop to improve bots continuously.

Alex: And I’ll say, remember, clear data storytelling and streamlined tooling go hand in hand to make complex information approachable.

Maya: Don’t forget, investing in your personal knowledge workflows makes all the difference in staying sharp and informed.

Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.

Alex: See you next time!
