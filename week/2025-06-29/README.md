_Turning 100,000 books into interactive stories reveals reader preferences with rich charts and elegant design._

- **First major release:** Added a preprocessing Python script [`9269039`](https://github.com/sanand0/booksviz/commit/9269039ac805ef256bea065c29108090b45b894a) to sample and filter Goodreads data for visualization, trimming data to a manageable 5,000 points for smooth user experience. Takeaway: Data curation upfront avoids sluggish frontends.
- **Interactive D3 scatter plots:** Built charts plotting pages, blurb length, and review counts against ratings, featuring LOESS trend lines and tooltips for context, from initial code drop [`d03246c`](https://github.com/sanand0/booksviz/commit/d03246c9ac86f8f3aeb8f0f2c49eb6776fe9b102). Takeaway: Bring data alive with interactive visuals, not just static plots.
- **Visual and narrative redesign:** Revamped article layout and styling [`173f610`](https://github.com/sanand0/booksviz/commit/173f610e8ff5e4825f0b30bed6e141d498755811) with modern fonts, color variables, responsive CSS, and a story-driven structure including hero banner and methodology sections. Takeaway: Presentation matters as much as data—dress your insights to impress.
- **Robust data loading improvements:** Switched from D3’s JSON loader to the Fetch API [`b34e1c2`](https://github.com/sanand0/booksviz/commit/b34e1c2c6419c5f70d0ab3ceedd42a4b1d204a1f) with error handling and ensured charts initialize after script loads, preventing race conditions. Takeaway: Don't trust assumptions—always handle data faults gracefully.
- **Polished final README and metadata:** Added rich documentation describing dataset, slides, and videos to guide users [`a1d6e91`](https://github.com/sanand0/booksviz/commit/a1d6e91ea86896b82149b6bfa293eb7cf688c6e6). Takeaway: Clear docs are the welcome mat for your project.

Yes, the internet really needed yet another book viz, but now it’s also stylish and smart.

### [sanand0/bootstrap-dark-theme](https://github.com/sanand0/bootstrap-dark-theme)

_Simplified dark mode toggling for Bootstrap-powered sites, minimizing setup with a neat HTML placeholder._

- **Embed toggle via placeholder div:** Instead of copy-pasting bulky HTML, users just drop a `<div class="bootstrap-dark-theme"></div>` in their navbar [`6d83694`](https://github.com/sanand0/bootstrap-dark-theme/commit/6d83694f334075039d818cc575c820c0d1535e7b). The script replaces it with a fully functional toggle. Takeaway: Minimal markup makes adoption frictionless.
- **CDN script shortcut:** Default script loading simplified to `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-dark-theme@1` [`422e163`](https://github.com/sanand0/bootstrap-dark-theme/commit/422e1635c15a33ee30af64a7e8b675617cd425b9), easing integration. Takeaway: Easy CDN setup speeds up experimental or quick dev.
- **Robust theme value handling:** Unknown or invalid themes now gracefully fallback to `auto` [`1.1.0` release notes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-dark-theme/v/1.1.0), avoiding UI breakage. Takeaway: Validate inputs to protect UX.
- **Updated docs with sample custom toggles:** Provided example dropdown toggles with icons using Bootstrap classes [`README.md`] for effortless customization. Takeaway: Show don’t just tell to inspire better UI fits.
- **Switched test runner invocation:** Use `npx` to run vitest instead of direct dev dependency [`6d83694`](https://github.com/sanand0/bootstrap-dark-theme/commit/6d83694f334075039d818cc575c820c0d1535e7b). Takeaway: Keep dev dependency chains trim and runnable.

Yes, you really needed another Fish abbr.

### [sanand0/talks](https://github.com/sanand0/talks)

_Sharing insights on using AI for data visualization and exploration, packed with tactical advice and multi-tool workflows._

- **Prompt-to-Plot talk added for VizChitra 2025:** A detailed workshop slide deck introducing how to find datasets, ideate stories, analyze, visualize, and publish with LLMs [`5138aaa`](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/commit/5138aaa74ae23a67c670096d7d9c0702f0a1dd40). Takeaway: Structured talks boost uptake of complex workflows.
- **Incorporated rich prompt examples:** Added prompts for dataset discovery, ideation, code generation, visualization, and aesthetics to README [`2025-06-28-prompt-to-plot/README.md`](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/blob/main/2025-06-28-prompt-to-plot/README.md). Takeaway: Preset prompts speed workshop demos and newbie onboarding.
- **Embedded QR codes and online links:** Slides and videos linked with QR codes and collaborative group invites for audience engagement [`d8ec876`](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/commit/d8ec8767836aac42ce7dda00280f086a994aa68e). Takeaway: Make participation a breeze with simple tech.
- **Transcript and video for 'Data Design by Dialogue':** Enabled richer access to talk content with synced media and transcripts [`9acdd71`](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/commit/9acdd7180c6f3514d811155a1e04acc5e669d5e1). Takeaway: Documentation is the best souvenir.
- **Added practical tactics and lessons learned:** Shared tips like “don’t ask for one, ask for a dozen” and encouraging quick iteration in slide notes. Takeaway: Share your battle scars as wisdom.

Tactical talks mean less pain for your audience and fewer “uhh, what now?” faces.

### [sanand0/til](https://github.com/sanand0/til)

_Improved LLM embedding workflows and key environment setup for seamless notes publishing._

- **Removed LLM Foundry dependency:** Now uses OpenAI API directly for embeddings [`edf0ec5`](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/edf0ec5dad967836d2ad2aa547c37a4c570e6c56), simplifying setup and reducing external reliance. Takeaway: Fewer dependencies, fewer headaches.
- **Pass OpenAI API key secret correctly:** CI workflow updated to use `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var for secure API calling [`a14f20e`](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/a14f20ef0972c5f14538fb7a59b5291d9533516b). Takeaway: Keep your secrets secret while deploying.
- **Better error handling for similarity API:** Detect failed embeddings API calls and report errors clearly [`501dbd5`](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/501dbd505edd93dc790860c3d531f9432043757f). Takeaway: Always fail loud, not silently.
- **Automated prettier formatting:** Runs prettifier on Markdown notices post-update [`501dbd5`](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/501dbd505edd93dc790860c3d531f9432043757f). Takeaway: Automate your boring chores.

Sometimes less is more—especially when it reduces your setup fuss.

## Lessons

- Automate data trimming and filtering early to keep visuals snappy and usable.
- Turn complex workflows into guided talks and share prompt templates to flatten learning curves.
- Use simple placeholders and minimal markup to supercharge accessibility for UI widgets.
- Error handling and fallback logic matter more than you think, especially in web frontends.
- Replacing dependencies wisely can speed deployment and reduce operational surprises.

## Suggestions

- For **booksviz**, add more interactive story panels or export options to share insights beyond the screen.
- For **bootstrap-dark-theme**, consider adding theme presets or integration with OS-level theme change listeners.
- For **talks**, expand with video demos showing prompt effects live for even clearer grasp.
- Evaluate adding user telemetry (privacy thoughtful!) to see which UI tweaks users prefer for future polish.
- Combine **til** embedding with semantic search or clustering to auto-group weekly notes by theme for better navigation.

Keep your stories vivid and your interfaces seamless—your users will thank you for both.
