Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of April 27, 2025!  
Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, here to guide you through some fascinating updates from Anand’s GitHub projects this week.

Alex: Let’s start with Anand’s mental math evaluations using AI models.  
Maya: The big advancement here? Documenting how 50 different AI models handle multiplying large numbers.  
Alex: Who thought AI could try mental math at all? But this shows they’re not quite calculators yet.  
Maya: Exactly! What’s cool is that some of the best models, like OpenAI’s reasoning variants, got six of seven problems right.  
Alex: That’s huge! These models use human-like tricks to break down big calculations — kind of like doing math in steps.  
Maya: And the evaluation now includes setup tips for API keys, making it easier for others to try. Why do you think adding setup instructions matters?  
Alex: It lowers the barrier for other developers to replicate or improve on the tests, which helps the whole AI community.

Maya: Next up, Anand polished the homepage that features all his projects.  
Alex: Yep, the list now groups repos by topic and shows usage stats, stars, and updated dates.  
Maya: It also has handy filters so you can find projects by what you’re interested in or when they were updated—making discovery much smoother.  
Alex: This is like giving a well-organized portfolio to anyone visiting the site.  
Maya: And a fresh script handles the page’s HTML generation and keeps things tidy with Bootstrap styling.  
Alex: What kind of user benefits can you see from this?  
Maya: Anyone can quickly spot active and relevant projects without sifting through heaps of info.

Alex: Speaking of visuals, there’s a slick update to the Marp slide plugin for SmartArt diagrams.  
Maya: Anand made the plugin modular and modern — now it supports Pyramid, Chevron, and Venn diagrams all in one go.  
Alex: Plus, it’s compatible with the Marp CLI, so you can create stylish visuals right from Markdown files easily.  
Maya: There’s even a new frontend app that lets you input your content and see slides instantly in your browser!  
Alex: That definitely helps presenters make their slides look more engaging, without needing complex graphic design tools.  
Maya: Why do you think integrating with Markdown and CLI tools is important?  
Alex: It keeps the workflow fast and text-based, perfect for developers and tech-savvy users who like coding their presentations.

Maya: Switching gears, the Rewriter app got a big refresh too.  
Alex: Yup, the app’s UI now relies on Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons for a cleaner, responsive look.  
Maya: It includes handy preset rewriting scenarios like polishing emails or simplifying technical docs you can pick with a click.  
Alex: Plus, the bookmarklet generator is simplified and more modular, letting users create custom text-rewrite tools with their own API keys and instructions.  
Maya: This is brilliant for anyone wanting instant, AI-powered text improvements on any webpage.  
Alex: Adding use cases also inspires users on how to apply it in real life, like boosting customer support or global team communication.  
Maya: How does such a bookmarklet empower everyday users?  
Alex: It puts powerful AI help just a bookmark click away, anywhere on the web—no need to switch apps or copy-paste.

Maya: Finally, Anand’s scripts and system setup got nice usability and environment improvements.  
Alex: Fish shell setups are faster and cleaner, with better virtualenv path handling and fewer slow startup tasks.  
Maya: Command abbreviations like ‘codex’ and ‘clip’ make common tasks faster. Also, added useful tools like ‘lynx’, ‘ngrok’, and a handy ‘md2rtf’ script for Markdown conversions.  
Alex: And the Linux setup notes now reflect real-world tweaks, like switching back to X11 for compatibility and handling gesture controls better.  
Maya: Small system improvements like these often save tons of time and reduce frustration every day.  
Alex: What’s your favorite benefit of optimizing your dev environment?  
Maya: Peace of mind and smoother workflows—so you focus on coding, not fighting your tools.

Maya: Here’s a quick tip you can try today — from the Rewriter updates, check out creating custom bookmarklets with tailored rewriting instructions.  
Alex: That’s clever! I’d use it to create a bookmarklet for quick tone adjustments before sending important emails. What about you?  
Maya: I’d make one for instant technical jargon simplification, helping me share clearer docs faster.

Alex: Remember, small tweaks can have big impact.  
Maya: Don’t forget to explore your tooling options to boost productivity and ease.  
Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.  
Alex: See you next time!
