Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of 08 Jun 2025!

Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, and today we’ll walk you through the highlights of Anand’s commits this week.

Alex: First up, let’s dive into the AI Pipe project—a backend service that lets you access OpenAI or OpenRouter APIs easily, even without your own backend.

Maya: The big update here is the addition of a new proxy feature. Now you can request any URL through AI Pipe’s `/proxy/` endpoint, which bypasses CORS restrictions.

Alex: That’s a game changer! No more browser CORS jokes when fetching external data for your front-end apps.

Maya: Exactly. And they made sure security isn’t compromised by stripping unsafe headers on both request and response sides.

Alex: They also split the playground JavaScript into its own module… Why do you think that helps?

Maya: It improves code readability and makes it easier to maintain, plus it simplifies loading scripts asynchronously.

Alex: Anand also added linting to run automatically before publishing the package, so the code style stays consistent—small but crucial for long-term health!

Maya: Another tweak: they fixed a subtle bug where URL search parameters were being dropped incorrectly after logging in. This preserves important query info for users.

Alex: Cool! Speaking of AI Pipe, they’ve enhanced their LLM interacting app—now you can customize the number of retry attempts for API calls and even continue ongoing conversations with a “Continue” button.

Maya: That means if the AI’s first answer isn’t perfect, you don’t have to start from scratch. It’s like having a patience knob for your AI assistant.

Alex: Switching topics, in the API Agent fully interactive app, they added a Google Workspace agent with OAuth support. So now you can query Gmail, Calendar, and Drive via natural language!

Maya: That’s huge. People can now ask, “What’s on my calendar tomorrow?” and get real-time answers. It automatically handles OAuth tokens elegantly too.

Alex: Plus, you can save your API tokens in the form and they persist across reloads, thanks to better saveform integration.

Maya: Speaking of saveform, the library itself got a nice upgrade. Now when you save a form, it merges stored values rather than overwriting everything.

Alex: So if your form dynamically changes and some fields get removed, it won’t lose their values from storage—that’s clever!

Maya: There was also a handy new code snippet added to scripts: an “unbrace” abbreviation that removes braces from single-line JS blocks to tidy up your code.

Alex: Super handy for quick refactoring or simplifying then/else chains.

Maya: Moving over to the tools collection, Anand added a fantastic new SpeakMD tool.

Alex: That’s the one that converts Markdown into a friendly, conversational script for audio narration, right?

Maya: Yes! It streams the output using LLMs, so you can see the text appear live, and then you can copy it or even have it read aloud via speech synthesis.

Alex: A great tool if you want to quickly generate podcast scripts or make your docs audio-friendly.

Maya: Also, the Google Suggest Explorer tool got a big UX refresh—search suggestions now appear in cards per country with clickable links, and the app can explain differences between countries using LLMs.

Alex: They made the LLM prompt smarter too—asking specifically for outliers or unique perspectives from countries, which makes the AI output more insightful and fun.

Maya: Nice! And the explorer also supports search history with delete-ability, making it easier to track and manage frequent queries.

Alex: Let’s not forget the new Hacker News Links Extractor! It scrapes article links from various Hacker News sources and outputs Markdown-readable lists.

Maya: Yes, it fetches HTML via a proxy, parses out relevant article links, and even sanitizes the link text for Markdown formatting.

Alex: That makes consuming Hacker News content far more convenient for knowledge aggregation or reading later.

Maya: Last but not least, the AWS RAG project was enhanced with a full CLI and API interface. You can now index documents, perform hybrid semantic and keyword searches, and run a production-ready FastAPI server.

Alex: Retrieval-augmented generation systems like this combine vector search with traditional keyword search to boost accuracy—a neat evolution from regular RAG.

Maya: Plus, the tool supports neat features like chunking huge documents, query rewriting, and generating sub-questions plus HyDE techniques for better context.

Alex: Super comprehensive! So many great updates across all these projects.

Maya: Here’s a quick tip you can try today: when saving form data in the browser, merge new values with existing ones instead of overwriting everything. This preserves user inputs even if your form dynamically changes.

Alex: That’s fascinating! I’d use that in multi-step forms or where fields appear/disappear dynamically—so users don’t lose data unexpectedly.

Maya: Exactly. Enhancing user experience by being forgiving about form changes makes your app feel thoughtful and reliable.

Alex: Remember, small tweaks can have big impact.

Maya: Don’t forget to check out your tooling options—the right library or pattern can save you hours.

Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.

Alex: See you next time!
