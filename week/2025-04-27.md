## Big Visuals, Smooth AI Flows, & Admin Power in APIs

A week bringing polished new presentation diagrams, sharper AI text rewriting tools, and deeper admin control for APIs. Plus practical updates on mental math evaluations, shell setups, and an automated homepage refresh.

### [marked-smartart](https://github.com/krishna-gramener/marked-smartart)

Make your Marp presentations pop with unified Pyramid, Chevron, and Venn diagram support all in one plugin.

- **All-in-One Plugin:** Merged separate plugins into a single `smartart-plugin.js` engine for seamless Marp diagram rendering ([4c219fe](https://github.com/sanand0/marked-smartart/commit/4c219fe73c10fee3f464f891ed4515b4c884bf40), 22 Apr 2025).

- **Full README:** Detailed usage, customization with width, height, font sizes, multi-diagram slides, and browser compatibility ensure you can dive in easily without headaches.

Because your Marp slides *needed* one more way to outshine everyone else’s.

### [rewriter](https://github.com/sanand0/rewriter)

Instantly polish any web text with AI right from your browser bar by creating personalized rewriting bookmarklets.

- **Slick New UI:** Refactored the entire page for a cleaner, Bootstrap-driven interface and replaced FontAwesome icons with Bootstrap Icons for modern style ([dd20d34](https://github.com/sanand0/rewriter/commit/dd20d34f8d3cf72095a7a73ce112b9750704131f), 22 Apr 2025).
- **Real Use Cases Included:** Added clickable cards outlining practical applications like customer support, sales, HR, marketing, and global English standardization to guide users on how to use this powerful tool ([README.md](https://github.com/sanand0/rewriter/blob/dd20d34f8d3cf72095a7a73ce112b9750704131f/README.md)).

- **API Connection Test:** Built-in button to verify your API credentials and model are working before generating the bookmarklet—a lifesaver before you start rewriting content.
- **Easy Bookmarklet Generation:** Enter a prompt, API info, model, and instantly get a drag-able rewrite button to add to your bookmarks bar for one-click AI text rewriting.

Now your emails, docs, and web copy get a professional polish without switching apps or losing focus.

### [scripts](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts)

Sharper Linux and Windows shell setups geared for productive coding, with AI workflow speedups and useful CLI tools.

- **Simplified .env Loading:** Switched to simple `source` usage for environment variables, making it work smoothly on both Fish and Bash shells ([3382754](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/33827542abd75497b6ed57efabb77d1422a1160e), 20 Apr 2025).
- **New CLI Tools Added:** Added handy abbreviations for `lynx` (terminal web browser), `ngrok` (secure tunnels), email and calendar utilities right in your shell ([fe7f63b](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/fe7f63bc930f9ec26f6bd4f224ee2b4af8864b4d), 25 Apr 2025).
- **Updated Linux Docs:** Refined gesture shortcuts, switched back from Wayland to X11 for better compatibility with peripherals and commands ([96df53a](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/96df53a283705a1c9f1a205dfe224d54af3767d0), 20 Apr 2025).
- **Structured Aliases & Abbreviations:** Migrated from heavy functions and aliases to light Fish `abbr` commands for faster shell startup and responsiveness ([90d34b7](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/90d34b7239197d69c3502d1e847b79dd503c1b72), 20 Apr 2025).
- **Helper Functions & Utilities:** Included clipboards, ascii recording, Python virtualenv paths, and optimized tools to make your workflow nearly frictionless.

Yes, you really needed a cleaner Fish and Bash path setup for more virtualenvs.

### [llmmath](https://github.com/sanand0/llmmath)

How good are large language models (LLMs) at mental multiplication? Turns out some are surprisingly crafty.

- **Setup Instructions Clarified:** Added explicit steps to export your OpenAI API key for hassle-free local testing ([3d56261](https://github.com/sanand0/llmmath/commit/3d5626118729782625a21515342ff32827e85fd7), 26 Apr 2025).
- **Restructured README:** Made results easier to scan with cleaner presentation of the multiplication questions and model rankings ([211341e](https://github.com/sanand0/llmmath/commit/211341eace5081b87b5aa56e99c0c65f0e370e4e), 26 Apr 2025).
- **Key Finding:** OpenAI’s top reasoning-focused models score 6 out of 7 correct on multiplications, missing only the hardest 9-digit one; amusingly, they mimic human mental math tricks.
- **Model Rankings:** DeepSeek V3 and some other OpenAI models follow closely with 5/7 correct; several current leading models from Google, Anthropic, and Meta get about 4/7.
- **Public Results Dashboard:** View detailed model performances and reasoning logs at [sanand0.github.io/llmmath](https://sanand0.github.io/llmmath/), where hovering over cells unveils step-by-step calculation rationales.

Turns out LLMs aren't calculators but real mental math maestros in disguise.

- **Encouragement for Demos:** Suggestions include trying the new Marp SmartArt, AI autoimprove workflows, and elimination game AI visualizations for hands-on insight.

If you're not automating your homepage updates yet, what are you even doing?

## Suggested Next Steps

- Craft a sample Marp presentation using the new `marked-smartart` plugin to showcase Pyramid, Chevron, and Venn diagrams together.
- Generate a rewriter bookmarklet with your own API key and prompt, then try polishing text directly on a webpage.
- Deploy the improved shell setup scripts on your machines for faster environment starts and smoother AI tool usage.
- Study the `llmmath` mental math results to assess which LLMs might suit your numerical or reasoning tasks best.
- Explore the `aipipe` admin APIs for fine-grained token usage control if you manage multiple AI users.
- Consider adding more AI-powered interactive demos to your tool collection — the `autoimprove` and `eliminationgame` projects offer rich examples.
