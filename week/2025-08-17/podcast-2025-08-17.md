Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of 17 Aug 2025!

Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, and today we’ll walk you through the highlights of Anand’s commits this week.

Alex: First up, let’s talk about Anand’s personal weekly notes repository, where he shares lessons and reflections on all things AI, coding, and productivity.

Maya: This week’s updates include fascinating insights from recent educational talks and deep dives into how AI is shaping learning.

Alex: One standout note is from the PyConSG Education Summit, where Anand discussed "Social Code Analysis." It’s about examining how students copy, learn, and collaborate on coding projects using AI tools.

Maya: Copying code was not just allowed—it was encouraged! Students even got bonus marks for the diversity of their code, which is a fresh take on learning together.

Alex: That’s interesting because it recognizes learning as a social process. Who you copy from and when you copy can massively affect learning outcomes.

Maya: Exactly! Anand also shared findings from his course where thousands of students submitted automated Python scripts analyzed by LLMs for selective data analysis and storytelling.

Alex: And there were clusters of identical code submissions—proof that peer influence and copying patterns impact learning pathways.

Maya: Beyond education, Anand added a cool feature in his note-taking app: star filters and search-as-you-type in the Ideator tool.

Alex: Oh, I love that. It’s like you can mark favorite notes and instantly filter through them—making ideation much smoother for creative workflows.

Maya: Plus, the Ideator now fetches notes from multiple sources, unifying search and improving error handling. Really neat UX improvements!

Alex: Also, the new LLM Document Editor is exciting. It lets you describe edits in natural language, and the model returns a diff patch you can apply live. No more manual fiddling!

Maya: That’s practical for content creators or developers who want AI to refine text seamlessly without losing context.

Alex: In the AI Pipe project, Anand integrated Google’s Gemini API as a new LLM provider, alongside OpenAI and OpenRouter.

Maya: Right, it’s a big deal because now web apps can use the Gemini models via AI Pipe’s proxy, with usage tracking and cost accounting.

Alex: Tests were added to ensure cost computation and streaming work well for Gemini, confirming this integration’s robustness.

Maya: On the web apps front, the Excel Converter got a major overhaul. It now supports output in JSONL, YAML, XML, and TOML from pasted spreadsheet data.

Alex: That’s such a versatile tool! Perfect for data scientists and developers needing to quickly convert spreadsheet exports into multiple formats.

Maya: And it features a nicely designed UI with dark mode, copy-to-clipboard, and download options, making it easy to use.

Alex: Lastly, Anand’s weekly things learned repository has enriched notes on AI coding strategies, computational thinking, and tooling setups—great to catch up on!

Maya: So many resources to explore! Before we sign off, here’s a quick tip related to note searching in Ideator: try starring your most important notes and use the live search filter.

Alex: That really sharpens your focus. Maya, how would you integrate that into your personal workflows?

Maya: I’d tag meeting notes that need follow-up and quickly filter them when planning next steps, saving time and avoiding clutter.

Alex: Brilliant use case!

Maya: Remember, small tweaks can have big impact.

Alex: Don’t forget to check out your tooling options.

Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.

Alex: See you next time!
