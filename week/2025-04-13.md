## A Week of Visual Masterpieces and Smart Shell Setup

This week delivers a shiny new Marp SmartArt plugin and a polished LLM-driven elimination game. Also, a slick analog clock, a powerful snake game, and improved shell environment setups join the party.

### [sanand0/an-lbs-exchange-program](https://github.com/sanand0/an-lbs-exchange-program)

_Easily get your eBook onto Amazon and as an ePub, with clear quickstart instructions._

- **Amazon and ePub added:** The README now links directly to the Amazon book and includes an [ePub version](https://github.com/sanand0/an-lbs-exchange-program/blob/9c2b75984d734d79771bee3edd00467f2275c843/an-lbs-exchange-program.epub), great for offline reading ([9c2b759](https://github.com/sanand0/an-lbs-exchange-program/commit/9c2b75984d734d79771bee3edd00467f2275c843), 12 Apr 2025).
- **Clear publishing steps:** Describes setup of KDP and how to generate covers using LLMs; confirms you can publish an eBook in around an hour.
- **Visual cover linking:** The cover image links to its Amazon store page, so you can admire your handiwork.
- **Practical workflow:** Updates your pandoc command to produce an ePub titled “An LBS Exchange Program.”

_Yes, you really needed another quick eBook how-to._

### [sanand0/marked-smartart](https://github.com/krishna-gramener/marked-smartart)

_Create beautiful Pyramid, Chevron, and Venn diagrams inside Marp slides with ease._

- **New Marp plugin:** Consolidates diagram types into a `smartart` code block with unifying syntax, simplifying usage ([33b3da8](https://github.com/krishna-gramener/marked-smartart/commit/33b3da8dfcdef09c276fe3d145690ab2adcea1f0), 11 Apr 2025).
- **Modular architecture:** Separate JS modules like `pyramid.js`, `chevron.js`, and `venn.js` handle respective diagrams; all utilities are shared ([smartart-plugin.js](https://github.com/krishna-gramener/marked-smartart/blob/33b3da8dfcdef09c276fe3d145690ab2adcea1f0/smartart-plugin.js)).
- **Rich styling options:** Customize width, height, font size, and colors directly in your Markdown—not to mention HTML embedding inside chevrons for the quirky user ([README.md](https://github.com/krishna-gramener/marked-smartart/blob/33b3da8dfcdef09c276fe3d145690ab2adcea1f0/README.md)).
- **Marp CLI compatible:** Run presentations via the CLI seamlessly using the custom engine with your diagrams rendered beautifully.
- **Examples and tests:** Includes comprehensive `.md` and `.html` test files to play with all diagram types together.

_Want to impress your future thesis committee with chevron diagrams? Now you can._

### [sanand0/scripts](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts)

_Setup scripts that cleanly add Python virtualenvs and improve Linux workstation configs._

- **Added Gramex virtualenv paths:** The PATH includes Gramex’s `.venv/bin` in both Bash and Fish setups for smooth environment activation ([dc97538](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/dc975388270f032536f6208130741e58dfbe21e6), 11 Apr 2025).
- **Linux setup doc updated:** Improved notes with Wayland fix for Foliate, and new keyboard shortcuts for Guake and Warp ([dc97538](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/dc975388270f032536f6208130741e58dfbe21e6)).
- **AI-specific code style rules added:** Clarified Python and JS variable naming conventions and editor practices ([b51ac19](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/b51ac19f95363609d76d93aa53796581ec8903d1), 8 Apr 2025).
- **Use PATH for uvx calls:** Fixed uvx directory context so LLM commands run in the current directory, no more sending you elsewhere ([45b1730](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/45b17300e17c7fad42cb021dbf13442606da0628), 7 Apr 2025).

_Yes, you really needed a cleaner Fish and Bash path setup for more virtualenvs._

### [sanand0/eliminationgame](https://github.com/sanand0/eliminationgame)

_Visualize LLMs playing Survivor with a neat interactive timeline and social insights._

- **Detailed documentation added:** Stepwise breakdown of LLM coding using Copilot explains how the visualization was built ([fd8bb7e](https://github.com/sanand0/eliminationgame/commit/fd8bb7ef16805b2352692a4772b7508250d2fe62), 10 Apr 2025).
- **Improved UI elements:** Sharper styling for arrows and circles; eliminated players are now hidden after jury rounds ([fd8bb7e](https://github.com/sanand0/eliminationgame/commit/fd8bb7ef16805b2352692a4772b7508250d2fe62)).
- **Clickable timeline and chat:** Rows and messages now react to clicks, jumping you to the relevant game step ([fd8bb7e](https://github.com/sanand0/eliminationgame/commit/fd8bb7ef16805b2352692a4772b7508250d2fe62)).
- **Rich UI with Bootstrap and Lit:** Tooltips, badges, and accordion-based sidebars enrich the exploration experience.
- **Brainy quote cards:** The home page features behavioral quotes mined from LLM conversations for added insight.

_Sometimes the best insights come from watching virtual backstabbing unfold step by step._

### [sanand0/autoimprove](https://github.com/sanand0/autoimprove)

_Become your own AI-powered code companion with UI demos and intelligent feedback._

- **Enhanced circle drawing demos:** Added interactive controls for color, size, opacity, spinning animations, and dragging to reposition ([264c757](https://github.com/sanand0/autoimprove/commit/264c75766f300e8a962300f96286465e88b4aa6a), 10 Apr 2025).
- **Game collection app:** Tabs feature Tic-Tac-Toe, Memory Game, and Number Guessing—all improved with better UI and interactive gameplay ([259bfc4](https://github.com/ Nitin399-maker/autoimprove-pull/commit/259bfc4e85c97b8275f70f663c72388c334ca066), 8 Apr 2025).
- **Collapsible code/explanation UI:** Folding feature on generated code blocks helps focus on what matters ([fd0ff08](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/autoimprove-pull/commit/fd0ff0878ded8917524e92fed31b0d55c5a90892), 10 Apr 2025).
- **Paint app refined:** Beautiful modern UI with synchronized brush and smooth controls, plus flood fill and spray paint tools ([assistant content on 10 Apr 2025]).

_From doodles to games to code, AI-driven app improvements are getting way more interactive._

## Suggested Next Steps
