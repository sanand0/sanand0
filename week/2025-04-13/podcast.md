Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of April 7th, 2025!  
Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, and today we’ll walk you through the highlights of Anand’s commits this week.

Alex: First up, the eBook publishing journey...  
Maya: Anand wrapped up his quick guide on publishing an eBook on Amazon.  
Alex: What caught my eye is he added the actual Amazon sales link and included the ePub version right in the repo!  
Maya: That means readers can either buy directly or download to read right away. Nice touch for accessibility.  
Alex: Exactly! Plus, the steps remain super practical – from setting up Kindle Direct Publishing to using ChatGPT for cover art.  
Maya: It’s impressive how open-source tools and LLMs speed up what used to be a tedious process.  
Alex: Makes you realize publishing is really just a few scripting tricks away.

Maya: Speaking of tricks, there’s also progress in the LLM pricing info.  
Alex: Yeah, a small fix to deploy on GitHub. The backend nitty-gritty that keeps things smooth.  
Maya: Reliability on details like these is why comparing LLM cost and quality stays up-to-date.  
Alex: True, even the best models need a sturdy base.

Alex: Shifting gears, the smart art diagrams now have a big upgrade!  
Maya: Yes, a new Marp plugin adds slick custom pyramid, chevron, and Venn diagrams.  
Alex: So no fuss creating professional diagrams inside markdown slides—just code blocks and you’re done.  
Maya: And each diagram is configurable with colors, sizes, and even fonts, making presentations so much richer.  
Alex: What’s your favorite? The chevrons for process flows?  
Maya: Definitely! Those arrow-shaped steps look so clean and intuitive.  
Alex: It’s great for anyone, even without graphic design skills, to communicate ideas clearly.  
Maya: The fact that it seamlessly coexists with Mermaid diagrams is a big win for flexibility too.

Maya: In personal tools, Anand improved his setup scripts once more.  
Alex: He added the path to the Gramex virtual environment, so it runs smoothly on multiple shells — bash and fish across Linux and Windows.  
Maya: Plus, updated the Linux notes with some neat things — fixed Foliate eBook reader on Wayland, and some new keyboard shortcuts for Guake and Warp.  
Alex: That’s the kind of polish that makes daily work frictionless.  
Maya: Every little tweak compounds over time.

Alex: Now, the most fun—Anand’s elimination game visualization.  
Maya: Right! He’s been working on showing how large language models play a Survivor-style game.  
Alex: This week, he added a detailed README with clear usage instructions and lots of screenshots to guide users.  
Maya: Also, navigation got smarter — you can click on alliances, votes, or chat messages to jump through game steps.  
Alex: And they even applied bug fixes to make the UI cleaner, like highlighting chat messages when hovered and improving the arrow styling.  
Maya: It really helps anyone explore the subtle “social” strategies LLMs use under the hood.  
Alex: What did you find fascinating about this?  
Maya: That the visualization turns complex model interactions into understandable stories—sort of like watching AI reality TV!

Maya: And to top it off, there’s exciting progress in the auto-improve repo.  
Alex: This involves prompting an LLM repeatedly to improve code step-by-step.  
Maya: They added new demos, including more games, and smarter code folding – making the output easier to view and interact with.  
Alex: This collaborative LLM coding approach can really boost how quickly we prototype and refine ideas.  
Maya: Have you tried anything like this, Alex?  
Alex: Absolutely! Having an AI iterate over my code saves hours, especially for UI tweaks.

Maya: Here’s a quick tip for our listeners: use smart plugins or snippets to generate diagrams or UI components instead of doing it from scratch.  
Alex: Definitely. It’s a huge time saver—and makes your presentations and apps stand out. How do you use this, Maya?  
Maya: I often start with template generators and customize as I go. It sparks creativity and keeps our flow smooth.

Alex: Well, remember, small tweaks can have big impact.  
Maya: Don’t forget to check out your tooling options—they constantly evolve and can transform your work!  
Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.  
Alex: See you next time!
