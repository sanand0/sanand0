Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand's Weekly Codecast for the week of 04 January 2026!
Maya: We're Alex and Maya, and today we'll walk you through the highlights of Anand's commits this week.

Alex: Big week for Anand's blog and website — he did a major content and platform tidy-up.
Maya: Right — he finished migrating the site to a static site setup, added a bunch of prompt pages, turned on code-copy buttons, and reworked templates and footer logic. What’s the practical effect of that?
Alex: For readers it means cleaner URLs under /blog, lots of new prompt pages you can browse, and a little "copy code" button on code blocks so you can grab examples with one click. For editors it means pages that should appear in the footer must live under the site’s pages/ area — the footer now only lists files that actually exist there.
Maya: And he changed the templates so you can add page-specific CSS classes through front-matter, and fixed wrapped code styling so long lines read nicely. That’s small but useful — you can make a post add a wrap-code class to improve readability.
Alex: He also expanded the deploy workflow to run on multiple branches and made the site rely on a few newer Hugo template functions. So if you build the site in CI, double-check your Hugo version — otherwise build errors can surprise you.
Maya: Non-obvious takeaway: when you move large amounts of content and normalize URLs, expect link fallout. Anand bulk-updated internal links to the new /blog paths — that’s why the site commit includes hundreds of content changes. If you ever restructure a site, plan a link-normalization pass and a way to serve redirects.

Alex: Anand also centralized his prompt library — he moved the prompts repo into the blog as live pages and replaced the originals with links. Why does that matter?
Maya: It reduces duplication and creates a single canonical place for prompts, which makes maintenance easier. Practically, anyone using those prompts should update bookmarks; authors should edit the blog pages instead of the old repo. And because the blog now hosts them, they get the same site styling and searchability as other posts.

Alex: Over in the data-visualization corner, Anand shipped a big new data story about Indian trade — an interactive investigative piece.
Maya: That project includes a full narrative, analysis notes, and a hefty D3-driven script for visualizations. The story is built from a large export-import dataset and pairs Codex and Claude analyses with interactive charts.
Alex: Practically, readers get a narrative-driven, interactive article that backs claims with data and code. For people who work with data, Anand included an ANALYSIS.md and the prompts he used so you can reproduce his steps or reuse the prompts in your own projects.
Maya: Non-obvious bit: he noted an import-coverage gap in the dataset and encoded it in his methodology — that's an important honesty move. If you reuse public datasets, flag coverage quirks early and surface them in the story.

Alex: On the tools front, there were UI and polish updates.
Maya: Yes — small UX improvements like better favicons and a tweak to the Trending Repos title, plus a larger mobile-responsive redesign of the trending-repos tool. The trending view now switches to a card layout on phones, keeps the table on desktops, and adds mobile sorting and touch-friendly interactions.
Alex: He also made the ideation tool open its prompt without forcing a specific model in the URL, so it uses whatever the browser or service defaults to — cleaner and more portable.
Maya: Takeaway: small UI changes and responsive layouts dramatically improve discoverability on phones. If you have a data table, think about a card fallback for mobile.

Alex: In his scripts and personal tooling repo, Anand removed a "plan" system skill and also deleted the Hetzner rclone systemd services and a weekly updater.
Maya: That’s an intentional cleanup — he removed the on-disk plan templates and helper scripts, and stopped automating a Hetzner mount. The docs and setup notes were updated accordingly.
Alex: Practical effect: less automation to manage, but if you relied on those systemd services or the plan tooling, you need to migrate your workflows or re-add them manually. He also added some helpful setup tweaks — a lossless webp helper and an explicit note about creating a Cloudflare R2 bucket, plus a few dev-image/tooling tweaks.
Maya: Non-obvious point: when you remove automations, remember to leave clear migration notes. Anand updated README and removed references where appropriate, but if you mirror his setup, check for any remaining instructions that reference removed services.

Alex: He also moved a small but handy script from the talks repo into the scripts repo — the slide renderer.
Maya: Right — the slide tool that renders markdown slides in the terminal was relocated into the scripts collection, and references in talks were updated to point to that centralized copy. So the effect is fewer scattered utilities and one source of truth for local tools.

Alex: Anand’s weekly notes repo got a big batch of updates too — TIL entries, book notes, and course ideas for a Jan 2026 teaching run.
Maya: He added a TDS Jan course plan and lots of December notes — book summaries, tooling tips (rclone, xz), and TODOs for apps. It’s useful if you follow his learning log: there are short pointers and links you can steal.
Alex: One small caution: some setup instructions in those notes still referenced the Hetzner rclone mount he removed from scripts — so cross-check when following setup docs. That mismatch is exactly the sort of thing to watch for after coordinating multiple repos.

Alex: Finally, docs for a tutorials / LLM integration project were improved — clearer examples for configuring OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Azure in local profiles.
Maya: He added example profiles, highlighted that Azure expects a deployment name as the model field, and included CLI test snippets. So it's easier to wire up model providers when you try to run the demo locally.
Alex: That’s a nice little quality-of-life change — fewer confusions when switching providers.

Maya: Quick practical ideas from across the week: if you run a site with lots of small tools and pages, treat prompts, tools, and site content as first-class content — centralize them, enable copy-to-clipboard for code, and add small metadata (date, folder) for better presentation and linking.
Alex: And when you publish a data story, include a reproducible analysis file and the prompts used — that makes your work both credible and reusable.

Alex: Listener tip: my quick, actionable tip this week is — if you’re restructuring a site, run a bulk link fix pass and add redirects, then pin the exact static-site generator version in CI. That prevents build surprises and preserves inbound links. Maya, how would you apply that?
Maya: I’d add a redirect map and a simple smoke test that crawls a few important pages after deploy. I’d also add a check in the CI job that prints the Hugo version and fails if it’s below the required minimum.

Maya: My tip: when you publish an interactive data story, include an ANALYSIS.md with the derivation steps and the prompts or code used to produce charts. That makes the work reproducible and invites others to build on it. Alex, how would you apply that?
Alex: I’d put the analysis and prompts in a small data/ folder alongside the story, and add a one-command script to rebuild the core charts. Then link that script from the story’s footer so curious readers can reproduce specific figures.

Alex: That’s it for our roundup. Thanks for listening — and thanks to Anand for sharing all these updates.
Maya: See you next week. Keep shipping and keep learning — bye!
