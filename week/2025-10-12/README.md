## A week of practical automation, clearer notes, and safer AI docs

Small infrastructure and doc changes made today’s tooling quieter and easier to use. The top lesson: invest in small automation and clear docs — they compound.

### [sanand0/scripts](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts)

_This repo turned into a toolkit: more reliable CLI sandboxes, automated transcript rollups, and tidier dotfiles. Small infra pays back in minutes saved every day._

- **Consolidated transcript pipeline:** Added a script and systemd service to merge call notes into one `transcripts.md` ([45a32d9](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/45a32d934b6ea342e529f3c6eb1272fcaf6c632b)) on 11 Oct 2025; it scans target headings and groups items by file. This centralizes scattered notes for easier review. Takeaway: automate aggregation so your “things I missed” stop living in random files.
- **Codex CLI sandboxed in Docker:** Added `codex.dockerfile` and `codex.sh` to run the Codex CLI predictably ([45a32d9](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/45a32d934b6ea342e529f3c6eb1272fcaf6c632b); also iterated on 08 Oct 2025). The script maps caches and preserves UID/GID to avoid root-owned files. Takeaway: containerize flaky CLIs to keep host systems sane.
- **Project-wide formatting:** Introduced a `dprint.jsonc` and wired it into README setup ([45a32d9](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/45a32d934b6ea342e529f3c6eb1272fcaf6c632b)) on 11 Oct 2025. This standardizes formatting for JSON, TS, Markdown, and more. Takeaway: a single formatter beats many style arguments.
- **Espanso snippets and emoji package:** Reworked base espanso matches and added an up-to-date emoji package ([230da80](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/230da8015117b638870e48f893bef305ab1e5560); [727032d](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commit/727032d123bbeac2712b2462e3626b8ebdb35e97)) on 11 Oct 2025. Your text expander now includes personal signatures, date vars, and full emoji shortcodes. Yes, you really needed another emoji pack. Takeaway: small input shortcuts multiply into real time savings.

### [sanand0/til](https://github.com/sanand0/til)

_Notes got cleaner and more useful. The repo now records LLM lessons, curated trending-repo flags, and idea notes._

- **New LLM learnings added:** Updated the LLMs notes with recent references and practical tips ([d71feb2](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/d71feb23e423a353235902bf94d117e20e83d127)) on 11 Oct 2025. The entries point to concrete threads and practical prompts. Takeaway: capture links and one-line lessons while they're fresh.
- **Curated trending repos:** Tweaked `trending-repos.tsv` to tag and skip entries with reasons (e.g., educational, API preference) ([b333d0a](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/b333d0aa72ae543a3560ae097fd9e719b09a2e43)) on 11 Oct 2025. This makes the list actionable for real projects. Takeaway: add a small column for “why skip” and your future self thanks you.
- **Core concepts & ideation:** Added long-form notes and ideator prompts to capture tactics and micro-templates ([dbed8b7](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/dbed8b703baa5b513261aa05bac21e959f209ee4); [daed039](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commit/daed039a34a72de9128b83364d9e4b633350ea31)) on 09–11 Oct 2025. These form a living patterns library. Takeaway: treat short lessons as reusable patterns, not one-off thoughts.

### [sanand0/prompts](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts)

_The prompt index gained structure. Prompts became easier to find and slightly more robust._

- **Prompt index expanded:** Added developer and ideation prompts to the README for discoverability ([5e28de0](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts/commit/5e28de01ce45d4678a298920534d39cb79b57ea9)) on 08 Oct 2025. This helps you pick the right prompt quickly. Takeaway: a tidy index reduces time hunting for the right instruction.
- **Built-in fact‑check step:** Added a fact-check phase to the article-review prompt ([f15f2e7](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts/commit/f15f2e7a4955a1c00147f54ce40644741e74b25a)) on 08 Oct 2025. The prompt now asks the model to list errors and inconsistencies. Takeaway: force a verification pass when you want reliable outputs. Yes, the model can be asked to be its own editor.

### [sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public)

_Teaching content grew more practical. New tutorials and docs lower the barrier for hands-on HTTP and Pydantic AI work._

- **HTTP requests guide added:** New `http-requests.md` covers curl, HTTPie, wget, and Postman with examples ([8cde547](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commit/8cde5470814f870a986c54f68e03096c17d6d94b)) on 08 Oct 2025. It includes quick auth and jq tips. Takeaway: keep short, copy-paste examples for common API tasks.
- **Pydantic AI deep dive:** Added a long `pydantic-ai.md` explaining typed agents and structured outputs ([8c9f2c2](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commit/8c9f2c228ec22b2fe4b5aea688b5698a85b11ce6)) on 08 Oct 2025. This helps build safer, validated AI pipelines. Takeaway: prefer structured outputs when you need reliable machine-readable results.
- **Live session FAQs and playlists:** Added many session transcripts, FAQs, and a playlist TSV ([d60d411](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commit/d60d411d4a5bc44642406780d7d2c3ff5847c4e6)) on 08 Oct 2025. Now students can follow exact session steps. Takeaway: publish transcripts so asynchronous learners can catch up fast.

### [sanand0/tools](https://github.com/sanand0/tools)

_Quick product changes and recall tweaks improved ideation and content recall._

- **Recall preload list refined:** Recall/Ideator preload now picks specific note files for consistent recall behavior (commit series around 05 Oct 2025). This targets high-signal notes. Takeaway: small curated caches beat blind full-syncs.
- **Trending-repos integration:** Added tooling around trending repos and transcript recall. This makes recall include fresh meeting notes. Takeaway: merge dynamic signals (transcripts) into tooling slowly and test.
- **Model switch for image generator references:** Updated docs to prefer cheaper, smaller image models in some pipelines (see repo). Takeaway: cheaper models often suffice for quick iterations.

### [gramener/imagegen](https://github.com/gramener/imagegen)

_The image pipeline got a cost-and-latency tweak to stay practical._

- **Switched image model to GPT-Image-1-Mini:** A push changed the default to the smaller model for speed and cost (08 Oct 2025). This trims time and spend for bulk image generation. Takeaway: match model cost to task fidelity early.

### [sanand0/datastories](https://github.com/sanand0/datastories)

_Story prompts expanded with more edge-case scenarios._

- **Added a failed browsing-history story prompt:** New prompt to handle a specific story format was added (05 Oct 2025). This captures a use case for narrative debugging. Takeaway: capture unusual examples so your generator learns the edge cases.

### [sanand0/aipipe](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe)

_Repository activity: initial PR lifecycle completed._

- **Create PR closed:** A pull request to create the repo landed and closed (11 Oct 2025). The project now exists for future pipeline work. Takeaway: close small scaffolding PRs early so follow-up features can iterate.

### [Nitin399-maker/datagen](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/datagen)

_Minor housekeeping._

- **Removed a branch:** Deleted `refactor` branch (06 Oct 2025). No code changes to review. Takeaway: prune stale branches often to reduce confusion.

### [sanand0/generative-ai-group](https://github.com/sanand0/generative-ai-group)

_Podcast and group notes kept current._

- **Podcast updated:** Small content push refreshed the podcast page (05 Oct 2025). Takeaway: keep community material fresh; listeners notice.

## Lessons

- Automate aggregation early. A small script that consolidates notes saves repeated manual work.
- Containerize unpredictable CLIs. Containers keep host systems tidy and reproducible.
- Prefer structured outputs for production AI. Pydantic-style validation avoids parsing surprises.
- Ship tiny docs with examples. Short, copy-paste snippets cut friction for learners.
- Curate what you preload. Targeted caches improve recall relevance and speed.

## Suggestions

- Add tests or linting for the transcript consolidator to catch header parsing regressions.
- Add a README snippet showing example runs for `codex.sh --build` and a quick smoke test.
- Publish a short asciinema demo of espanso snippets and the new base matches.
- Run dprint in CI to enforce formatting before commits land.
- Add a cost/perf note to the imagegen README explaining when to use the Mini model.

If you want, I can draft the README demo for codex.sh and a tiny CI config for dprint.
