Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand's Weekly Codecast for the week of 25 January 2026!
Maya: We're Alex and Maya, and today we'll walk you through the highlights of Anand's commits this week.

Alex: Big week. Which project do you want to start with?
Maya: Let's begin with Anand's toolbox of tiny web apps — the one that hosts lots of single‑page utilities and bookmarklets. He made a bunch of visible, useful changes there.

Alex: Right — what's the headline?
Maya: He added two new user-facing tools and a flurry of polish. First, a Color Table Builder: paste a CSV or other delimited table, and it builds a minimal, semantic HTML table with value‑based cell coloring and a copy-to-clipboard button. It auto-detects headers, trims whitespace, handles percentages sensibly, offers d3 color gradients or custom low/high colors, and chooses readable black/white text on top of colored cells.

Alex: So instead of fussing around in a spreadsheet to color numbers for a report, you paste, adjust a gradient, and copy ready-to-use HTML?
Maya: Exactly. Practical for docs, blogs, or reports where you want a lightweight, accessible table without a stylesheet. Non-obvious win: the generated table includes scope attributes for headers, so screen readers get better semantics — that’s thoughtful accessibility baked into a small tool. And he added unit tests to make sure parsing, percentage handling, clipboard copying and pipe-delimited input keep working.

Alex: Nice. What else landed in the tools collection?
Maya: He added a Copy Links bookmarklet and a UI page for it. The bookmarklet scrapes every common URL and embedded asset on a page — links, images, iframes, scripts, video/audio sources — deduplicates them, and copies a TSV (URL plus a short, trimmed description) to your clipboard. The page that makes the bookmarklet is safe and tries to load the script from a configurable path, shows status, and falls back gracefully if the Clipboard API isn’t available.

Alex: That feels very practical for research or archiving a page’s resources.
Maya: Totally — think saving all assets for a web archiving exercise or dropping into a spreadsheet for quick analysis. Non-obvious detail: the implementation prefers the modern navigator.clipboard.writeText but has a textarea execCommand fallback for older browsers, so it’s resilient in the wild.

Alex: I also noticed a lot of changes to the Gemini conversation scraper.
Maya: Yes — he modularized and hardened the scraper so it’s a testable module instead of an inline blob. The scraper now exposes functions for extracting, copying, and scraping conversations, expands collapsed “thoughts” panels before copying (so you don't miss hidden content), waits a short settle delay for rendering, and collapses internal "thinking" blocks into an HTML details/summary when converting to Markdown. He also standardized the bookmarklet UI pattern across tools: a drag-to-bookmarks button with a loader and friendly alerts.

Alex: Why does modularizing matter here?
Maya: It makes the code callable from different contexts — as a bookmarklet, from the console, or in tests. Robust DOM parsing and the expand-before-scrape behavior prevent missing asynchronously-loaded sections. The upshot: more reliable copies of full conversations, fewer surprises when running the bookmarklet on real pages.

Alex: Any broader housekeeping worth calling out?
Maya: He moved toward ESM modules across the site, tightened linting/formatting order, unified page layouts with consistent Bootstrap styles (and a dark theme), and ran a lot of small lint fixes. Also, several small tools got safety and output improvements — for example, the Unicoder tool received better decoding for code blocks, safer rendering that avoids HTML injection, and a renderer for horizontal rules that emits markdown dashes instead of leaking <hr> tags.

Alex: So usability and safety improvements across the board, with a few exciting new tools.
Maya: Yes, and the tests he added for the color tool and other parts show he's thinking about maintaining quality as features grow.

Alex: Cool. Speaking of content, Anand did a big round of updates to his blog and site. Tell me about that.
Maya: The blog got a major content and asset migration. He moved many images and CSVs to a central files CDN so posts use secure, stable URLs instead of relative or fragile local paths. He added several new posts and long-form notes — including a deep Stormlight notes page and two 2026 posts comparing image model outputs and announcing the Gemini scraper — and fixed a bunch of small editorial issues.

Alex: He also added a travel page, right?
Maya: Yes. He introduced a pages/where.md that lists his travel schedule and added a script that reads a Dropbox CSV and injects the travel dates into that page automatically during setup. The build script runs the updater so the published site stays current without manual editing.

Alex: That’s neat — it automates a part of publishing that otherwise gets stale.
Maya: Exactly. Practical takeaway: if you have recurring content that originates from another source (a spreadsheet, calendar, or CSV), make the site regenerate it during build so you avoid stale copies and manual sync errors. He also documented a frontmatter class called wrap-code that forces code blocks to wrap in articles — small but very helpful for long code snippets.

Alex: Anything else on the blog side?
Maya: He fixed embeds to use responsive wrappers and HTTPS iframe sources, disabled appending a footer to generated email HTML to avoid unexpected injection, and made lots of link rewrites to the CDN for consistency and security. Overall, it's about making content robust, secure, and portable.

Alex: Nice. What about his small CLI / converter — the ChatGPT-to-Markdown tool?
Maya: He improved the Claude conversation converter so generated Markdown includes a clickable link back to the Claude chat and an Updated timestamp, aligned with the ChatGPT converter’s metadata. Tests were updated to assert the new metadata, and he bumped the package version. So saved conversations now carry both Created and Updated dates and a direct URL for quick reference.

Alex: That makes exported conversations immediately actionable — you can jump back to the chat.
Maya: Exactly — small UX win for people archiving chats or sharing references.

Alex: I saw a TIL / course repo update too.
Maya: The Things-I-Learned and course materials got substantive updates. He added a Jan 2026 course curriculum for the Tools-in-Data-Science class with prompt patterns and a full proposed TOC, added app idea TODOs, refreshed LLM links, and updated a trending-repos list. So it's a mix of course planning and curated resources for students.

Alex: That helps students and future auditors pick projects and follow the course patterns.
Maya: Yes — the curricular prompt patterns are especially useful: simple, repeatable prompts like "What are the failure modes?" or "How would I validate this without running code?" are great scaffolding for reproducible student work.

Alex: Any cross-cutting themes you noticed across these changes?
Maya: A few. First, make small tools robust: fallbacks for Clipboard, tests for parsing, expand dynamic content before scraping. Second, prioritize reproducible builds and external asset hosting — that CDN move plus auto-generated travel pages reduces fragile manual steps. Third, thoughtful accessibility and semantics — scope attributes, readable contrast choices, and safe rendering — which matter even for small utilities.

Alex: Great wrap of the main stuff. Let's give listeners a quick practical tip each.
Maya: My tip: try the Copy Links bookmarklet approach on any research page. Drag a bookmarklet to your bar or use a small snippet that collects common selectors, dedupes URLs, and copies TSV. Then paste into a spreadsheet and add columns for where you found each asset and why you saved it. Alex, how would you apply that?

Alex: I'd use it to audit incoming resources for a project — scrape links from a reference page, paste into a sheet, and add quick tags for "image", "data", "paper" so I can triage what to download and archive. My tip: when publishing content, serve static assets from a single CDN or files host and update links in a build step. It saves time and prevents broken images later. Maya, would you use that on your site?

Maya: Absolutely — especially for embeds and long-lived posts. It also makes it simple to rotate assets without changing posts. For a course site, I'd pair it with a small script that injects dynamic lists (like his travel updater) so things stay current.

Alex: Nice. Any quick extra tip from the tools discussion?
Maya: One more: when you build small UI utilities that generate code or HTML, include semantic attributes and tests early. It pays off for accessibility and maintenance.

Alex: I'll add: if you export chat logs or AI conversations, include both Created and Updated timestamps plus a link back to the source — it makes later review and citation far easier.

Maya: Great notes. That’s it for this week.

Alex: Thanks for listening. See you next week for another round of Anand’s commits.
Maya: Bye for now — happy hacking and safe publishing!
