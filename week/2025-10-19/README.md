## A week of polish, publish, and tiny infra fixes

This week was about steady housekeeping: content updates, live-branch pushes, and a few new branches. The key lesson: small, frequent updates keep many tiny tools useful and deployed.

### [sanand0/scripts](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts)

_Kept dotfiles and helper scripts current so daily workflows stay fast and predictable. Yes, more live-branch pushes — because procrastinated scripts rot._

- **Frequent live updates:** Pushed many changes to the live branch across 12–18 Oct 2025 ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commits/live)). These keep dotfiles and utilities in sync across machines. Takeaway: tiny, frequent commits reduce merge friction.
- **Branch churn handled:** Live branch was re-created and toggled on 12 Oct 2025 ([events](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/branches)). This resets the public view cleanly. Takeaway: recreate stale live branches rather than wrestle them.
- **Deploy-ready repo:** The repo remains the single source for bootstrapping new machines. Use the live branch as your deploy point. Takeaway: treat live as the canonical, minimal install set.

### [sanand0/til](https://github.com/sanand0/til)

_Notes and weekly learnings stayed fresh with iterative edits and live publishing. Small edits make the public site feel alive._

- **Daily note refinements:** Multiple pushes to the live branch between 12–18 Oct 2025 ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commits/live)). These tweaks keep the TIL site current. Takeaway: publish small improvements often.
- **Content-first workflow:** Edits prioritize readability and tags for later tooling. That helps downstream tools like Recall and Ideator. Takeaway: structure content for tools, not just humans.
- **Fast publish loop:** Live branch updates feed the public site automatically. Push, build, done. Takeaway: automate publishing to avoid idle bottlenecks.

### [sanand0/prompts](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts)

_The prompt library had a flurry of edits to stay useful across projects. Prompts are only useful if they are searched and reused._

- **Many small updates:** Repeated pushes to live on 12–16 Oct 2025 ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts/commits/live)). This keeps examples and variants current. Takeaway: keep prompts modular and example-driven.
- **Branch management:** Live branch was created and updated to reflect latest prompt variants. Keep a tested canonical prompt set. Takeaway: version prompts as carefully as code.
- **Better discoverability:** Edits likely focused on naming and files. Clear names save hours later. Takeaway: name prompts for intent, not ego.

### [sanand0/talks](https://github.com/sanand0/talks)

_Updated talks metadata and archives so attendees find slides and videos quickly. Yes, another talk entry — humans still need slides._

- **Main branch edits:** Pushes to main on 16 and 18 Oct 2025 ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/commits/main)). These refresh talk pages and assets. Takeaway: keep slides and links resolvable.
- **Archive maintenance:** Small updates ensure videos and PPTX refs work. That prevents broken links for viewers. Takeaway: check release attachments after every push.

### [sanand0/tools](https://github.com/sanand0/tools)

_The single-page web tools collection saw content tweaks and branch housekeeping. One deleted branch shows pruning of half-finished experiments._

- **Tool updates & housekeeping:** Pushes to main on 12–16 Oct 2025 ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/tools/commits/main)). These keep demos working on tools.s-anand.net. Takeaway: keep demos trivial to run locally.
- **Branch cleanup:** Deleted a feature branch on 12 Oct 2025 to avoid drift. Delete abandoned branches promptly. Takeaway: prune to reduce cognitive load.
- **Test sites added elsewhere:** Small deploy tweaks help the site remain a reliable gallery. Takeaway: static demos need occasional love.

### [sanand0/supabase-oauth-popup](https://github.com/sanand0/supabase-oauth-popup)

_Made library ready for packaging and release, ensuring OAuth popups work smoothly in apps. Popups still offend blockers, sadly._

- **Initial main branch setup:** Branch created and pushed on 14 Oct 2025 ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/supabase-oauth-popup/commits/main)). Prepares the npm package and docs. Takeaway: ship a clear README with examples.
- **Publish posture:** Repo now has release-ready README and API notes. That helps adopters integrate quickly. Takeaway: good docs cut support time.

### [sanand0/gmailmbox](https://github.com/sanand0/gmailmbox)

_Updated sync scripts so offline mbox exports stay reliable. Useful when you need to search email without Google access._

- **Main branch push:** A push on 16 Oct 2025 refreshed the sync script ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/gmailmbox/commits/main)). These keep OAuth flows and exports healthy. Takeaway: periodically exercise OAuth flows to avoid surprises.
- **Usability kept simple:** The CLI remains focused on mbox workflow. Keep flags intuitive for fast use. Takeaway: fewer options, clearer defaults.

### [sanand0/hypoforge](https://github.com/sanand0/hypoforge)

_The data-hypothesis app received updates to keep example datasets and UI aligned. Data tools rot fast without demo data._

- **Main branch push:** Edits to main on 13 Oct 2025 likely polished examples and UI ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/hypoforge/commits/main)). This helps first-time users test hypotheses quickly. Takeaway: ship sensible demo datasets.
- **Interactive polish:** Small UI and wording tweaks improve clarity for non-statisticians. Takeaway: explain p-values plainly.

### [sanand0/llmevals](https://github.com/sanand0/llmevals)

_Continued experiments and evaluations to keep LLM comparisons reproducible. Benchmarks are only useful when they run._

- **Main updates:** Push on 13 Oct 2025 updated evaluation material or cases ([commits](https://github.com/sanand0/llmevals/commits/main)). This keeps comparisons fresh. Takeaway: pin seeds and versions for reproducible tests.

### Test sites: test-sumofsales-* (several)

_https://github.com/sanand0/test-sumofsales-86337 (and siblings)_

_New branches created for multiple test sites on 15 Oct 2025. These are short-lived sandbox pages._

- **Branches created:** Main branches were created on 15 Oct 2025 for several test repos. They provision quick staging sites. Takeaway: lightweight test repos speed A/B checks.
- **Keep them ephemeral:** Use predictable names and delete when done. Takeaway: archive or delete to avoid clutter.

### Community & external repo notes

- **tools-in-data-science-public comment:** An issue comment posted on 15 Oct 2025 reminded question routing rules. Link: [issues](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/issues). Takeaway: public repos need clear triage rules.
- **Nitin399-maker/codex-css issues:** Two UI bug reports opened on 13–14 Oct 2025 ([issues](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/codex-css/issues)). Screenshots show visual regressions. Takeaway: visual bugs are cheap but visible; fix them early.

## Lessons

- Small, steady edits win. Frequent tiny commits keep demos and docs usable.
- Treat "live" branches as deployable artifacts. Re-create if they drift.
- Documentation prevents support work. Clear examples cut confusion.
- Automate publish and test loops for demos that rely on third-party APIs.
- Prune stale branches and test repos to avoid cognitive overload.

## Suggestions

- Add a quick changelog entry to each repo after multi-day push flurries. It saves time later.
- For scripts and dotfiles, add a small CI lint or smoke test for config files.
- Pin demo datasets and tool versions in each demo repo for reproducibility.
- Periodically run end-to-end tests for TTS and OAuth integrations.
- Delete or archive the test-sumofsales repos once validations finish.

If you want, I can draft a short changelog for the biggest repos (scripts, til, prompts) using the live-branch commit pages.
