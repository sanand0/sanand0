## Model Updates, Browser Histories, and Visual Storytelling Tech

This week brought a fresh round of updates to LLM pricing models, a new browser feature release visualization built entirely with AI-generated code, and a clever plugin adding Venn diagrams to Markdown. Plus, insights from instructors on how LLMs are impacting education rounds out the highlights.

_Latest model rankings and cost-quality data got a thorough refresh to keep your price-quality tradeoffs spot on._

- **Comprehensive model list update:** Over 400 lines in `elo.csv` were refined with new, reordered models and updated scores, ensuring up-to-date comparison data ([918ed7f](https://github.com/gramener/llmpricing/commit/918ed7f339a9c1f02eab16b705375caf2754aa25), [5837624](https://github.com/gramener/llmpricing/commit/583762467f734cb5c7c1f90876bb6cc73b8c0b35)) from 23 Mar and 29 Mar 2025.
- **README timestamp refresh:** The documentation now shows the latest update date to warn you this data isn’t stuck in the past ([918ed7f](https://github.com/gramener/llmpricing/commit/918ed7f339a9c1f02eab16b705375caf2754aa25)).
- **Pareto-front distinctions remain:** Top-tier green and red "avoid" labels continue guiding your LLM choices without facepalms.

Yes, your spreadsheet for choosing models just got a dose of new data magic.

### [sanand0/webfeatures](https://github.com/sanand0/webfeatures)

_An AI-only visual data story revealing how browsers race to ship new features — now with smooth dark mode toggling._

- **Initial launch of a pure AI-crafted web story:** The first fully integrated Bootstrap app uses real MDN browser data showing per-year feature release delays and counts ([16b1bf9](https://github.com/sanand0/webfeatures/commit/16b1bf96e92dd3c5c1dbf88c52f36223dac05965)). The README and scripts explain how timed feature delays and ranks are calculated and visualized with D3.
- **Switched from tables to bubbles:** The UI got a facelift—no more dull tables, just colored bubbles sized by feature counts and colored by delay, with grid lines crossing the centers for clarity ([0575ecc](https://github.com/sanand0/webfeatures/commit/0575ecc4aaf9d86104cd16c6d6e54e12498b359b)).
- **Dark mode toggle added:** Dark theme can now be switched with a dropdown using Bootstrap Icons and handy scripts, preserving readability with subtle styling tweaks ([0b314b5](https://github.com/sanand0/webfeatures/commit/0b314b509544879bf1284c585694ffe340d2ec8c)).
- **Narrative added to README:** Describes how the dataset and visual were made, plus stories about browser evolution (like IE, Firefox, and Chrome battles), generated by Gemini AI ([1607fb0](https://github.com/sanand0/webfeatures/commit/1607fb083aaf4744ba3bbddb0872cc28e86bb0ef)).
- **CI/CD for GitHub Pages:** Added workflow to automatically deploy updated visuals monthly or on demand—because who wants stale data? ([16b1bf9](https://github.com/sanand0/webfeatures/commit/16b1bf96e92dd3c5c1dbf88c52f36223dac05965)).

Turns out telling browser history visually is much more fun when AI writes both code and storyline.

### [sanand0/llms-in-education](https://github.com/sanand0/llms-in-education)

_Collecting instructor views and practical applications about LLMs changing the classroom._

- **Expanded notes on LLM use in courses:** Rich details about how students struggle with blind copy-pasting and how LLMs can create personalized feedback and automated grading ([a2bbeca](https://github.com/sanand0/llms-in-education/commit/a2bbeca94d1ee9ce3c718adacb9455fbb4a92f6a)).
- **Curriculum redesign with AI help:** Examples of refreshing courses with AI suggestions for emerging topics like Docker and GitHub Actions.
- **Transcriptions & FAQs:** Using transcription models to convert live sessions to searchable FAQs, driving up attendance.
- **Discussions on copying patterns:** Visualizations and insights about who copies, when, and how it affects learning outcomes.
- **Planned LLM-powered enhancements:** From virtual instructor chatbots to contextualized question generation and automated test cases.

So students may misbehave, but AI-powered tutors never need a coffee break.

### [sanand0/marked-smartart](https://github.com/sanand0/marked-smartart)

_Adds true Venn diagram support and examples to Markdown rendered by marked.js._

- **New Venn diagram plugin:** Supports three-circle Venns with automatic layout, colored regions, and HTML content inside intersections ([b647001](https://github.com/sanand0/marked-smartart/commit/b647001022aa2604bd20c7906939617a65764bdd)).
- **Examples included:** Basic sets, custom colors, and HTML labels with emoji for fun visual flair in docs ([b647001](https://github.com/sanand0/marked-smartart/commit/b647001022aa2604bd20c7906939617a65764bdd)).
- **Integration with marked.js:** Auto-parses fenced code blocks starting with ```venn, making diagrams as simple as writing text.

Because why just write lists when you can overlap your data beautifully?

## Suggested Next Steps

- For **llmpricing**, curate a dynamic dashboard displaying updated model pricing and quality trends over time.
- For **webfeatures**, consider adding live filters or comparisons between mobile vs desktop browsers for more granular insights.
- In **llms-in-education**, design a hands-on tutorial or demo showing how personalized feedback automation works end-to-end.
- For **marked-smartart**, explore extending diagram support to more complex logic sets or Euler diagrams.

The pieces are on the board—now let’s see these features connect and play nicely for end-users!
