## Quiet Week with No Commits

Sometimes, a week without changes means stability and focus elsewhere. It’s a good moment to review, plan, and prepare for what’s next.

## Lessons

- **Value of pauses:** No new code can mean a break to consolidate your project’s foundations.
- **Plan for momentum:** Use downtime to think about improvements or tech debt to tackle soon.

## Suggestions

- Conduct a codebase audit to identify hidden bugs or inefficiencies.
- Sketch out features or refactors that align with upcoming goals.
- Engage the community for feedback or contributions to keep the project vibrant.
