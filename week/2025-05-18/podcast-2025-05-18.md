Alex: Hello and welcome to Anand’s Weekly Codecast for the week of 18 May 2025!

Maya: We’re Alex and Maya, and today we’ll walk you through the highlights of Anand’s commits this week.

Alex: First up, let’s dive into Anand’s work on that fascinating project testing the mental math skills of large language models.

Maya: Right! This week, Anand improved how the multiplication results from 50 different models are displayed. Now, it shows all responses each model gave in a neat numbered list when you hover over the results.

Alex: That’s such a handy feature. Instead of just seeing a score, you get to peek inside the model’s reasoning or errors. It’s like looking over the shoulder of the AI as it does math.

Maya: Exactly. Plus, the table’s colors now use a smart gradient from red to green so you instantly see which models do well. And all numbers are right-aligned, making the data easier to scan.

Alex: Did you notice he also ran each multiplication test five times to improve reliability? That’s a good practice to smooth out randomness in AI responses.

Maya: Definitely. Repeated measures give you confidence the results reflect true performance, not just lucky guesses. It’s kind of like doing multiple trials in a science experiment.

Alex: So, for our listeners, this means Anand’s showing us thoughtful ways to evaluate AI math skills, making the complex data intuitive and transparent.

Maya: Moving on, Anand also made some neat updates to his personal website that lists his GitHub repositories.

Alex: Yes! Now, when you click on a repo card, it opens the app’s homepage if it exists, and the footer links to the GitHub repo and stargazers. It’s a slick UX upgrade.

Maya: Plus, he made sure repos without any assigned topics still show up. That avoids missing interesting projects just because they lack tags.

Alex: Such little refinements really enhance discoverability and navigation for visitors. This shows how attention to small details matters.

Maya: On the education front, Anand updated his "Tools in Data Science" course content.

Alex: That’s right. The README now includes new teaching assistants added to the team, which is great for student support.

Maya: And he added fresh educational material about LLM agents — AI systems that can plan, act, and learn through multi-step reasoning with tools. It’s like giving AI a brain, hands, and memory!

Alex: He also shared a minimal example Python script that acts as a command-line agent. It takes a text task, writes and runs code, then interprets results, retrying if needed.

Maya: That’s a wonderful resource. It gives students a hands-on glimpse into how autonomous AI agents work behind the scenes.

Alex: Also, he fixed the course links so students refer to the right term’s content, like January 2025’s modules.

Maya: Speaking of tools, Anand added a cool WhatsApp thread viewer web app in his tools collection.

Alex: Yes! It takes JSON data scraped from WhatsApp chats and displays messages with quoted replies in a threaded, easy-to-follow layout. That’s great for context.

Maya: Thanks to updates in his WhatsApp scraper too, which now extracts quoted message IDs and message times more accurately. This makes threading possible and reliable.

Alex: And the scraper can handle system messages like message deletions gracefully, making the data cleaner.

Maya: He even improved the bookmarklet for scraping, making it easy for users to drag and use in their browsers.

Alex: Pretty neat! These changes help researchers, analysts, or anyone wanting to explore chat histories with context intact.

Maya: Lastly, Anand updated his workstation setup scripts. He removed Conda from the bash prompt since he doesn’t use it much now.

Alex: He also added new software like Opera browser, ffmpeg, w3m text browser, Google Cloud SDK, PostgreSQL client, Supabase CLI, and VLC for media. It’s a solid development and productivity environment.

Maya: Plus, there’s a handy addition to his fish shell configuration to support better Markdown-to-HTML conversions with GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions.

Alex: That’s awesome—for those of us who write notes or docs in Markdown, better HTML export means cleaner presentations.

Maya: Here’s a quick tip you can try today: When displaying tabular data with varying accuracy or scores like Anand did with the AI models, using color scales and popovers to show detailed info can really improve user experience.

Alex: I agree, Maya. I’d also use that in dashboards where you want to keep summaries concise but allow deep dives on demand.

Maya: So, remember that layering your information lets you serve both quick glances and detailed explorations in one interface.

Alex: Great takeaway! Another one from me: Small improvements like fixing links or adding clear labels can make navigating projects way more pleasant.

Maya: And don’t forget to audit your tooling options often. Adding or trimming software thoughtfully keeps your workflow fresh and efficient.

Maya: That’s all for this week on Anand’s Weekly Codecast.

Alex: See you next time!
