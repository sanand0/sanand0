## A week of polishing homes for notes, stories, and scripts

Small, frequent edits kept sites, notes, and tooling in sync this week. The key lesson: keep content and tooling deployable with tiny, repeatable pushes.

### [sanand0/scripts](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts)

_This repo is your workstation’s Swiss Army knife; small edits multiply into daily time savings._

- **Frequent live edits:** Pushed many small changes to the live branch on 25 Oct 2025. See the branch activity at [commits/live](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/commits/live). These keep dotfiles and helpers current. Takeaway: small, focused commits reduce config rot.
- **Tooling hygiene:** Many pushes suggest tweaks to setup and services. Peek at the README and scripts to see likely targets: [README.md](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/blob/live/README.md). These avoid surprises during machine setup. Takeaway: update install docs whenever you tweak scripts.
- **Fast iteration cadence:** Multiple pushes across days (19–25 Oct 2025) show iterative fixes and rollouts. Link: [branches](https://github.com/sanand0/scripts/branches). Iteration beats big rewrites for personal infra. Takeaway: ship often; rollback is cheap.
- **Yes, you really needed another helper:** Expect tiny UX wins like new aliases or service tweaks. Takeaway: if a change saves one repetitive keystroke, it pays back quickly.

### [sanand0/datastories](https://github.com/sanand0/datastories)

_Story edits and deploys keep visual narratives fresh for readers and portfolio viewers._

- **Content updates:** Multiple pushes to main on 25 Oct 2025 updated story pages. See recent commits at [commits/main](https://github.com/sanand0/datastories/commits/main). This keeps examples timely and accurate. Takeaway: refresh visuals after data or date shifts.
- **Site polish:** Commits likely adjusted README, assets, or build metadata. Check the repo root: [README.md](https://github.com/sanand0/datastories/blob/main/README.md). Small polish improves first impressions. Takeaway: visual polish amplifies technical credibility.
- **Deployment-ready changes:** Pushing to main suggests a live-site deploy cycle. Preview your site at the GitHub Pages URL in the repo. Takeaway: automate the build to avoid manual deploy steps.
- **Light aside:** Yes, another chart got a color tweak. Takeaway: consistent palettes cut cognitive load for readers.

### [sanand0/til](https://github.com/sanand0/til)

_Notes and weekly “things I learned” evolved this week, keeping the public journal usable and searchable._

- **Rapid note updates:** Many pushes to the live branch between 19–25 Oct 2025. See [commits/live](https://github.com/sanand0/til/commits/live). These update daily notes and tags. Takeaway: frequent micro-entries preserve memory better than long essays.
- **Site generation changes:** Edits probably touched convert.js or publish scripts that generate public/ pages. Relevant file: [convert.js](https://github.com/sanand0/til/blob/live/convert.js) (check branch). Takeaway: keep build scripts reproducible and logged.
- **Tagging and embeddings:** The repo’s pipeline tags notes via embeddings. Confirm OPENAI env usage in README. Takeaway: automated tags scale searchability.
- **Wry aside:** The journal grows like a bonsai—trim often. Takeaway: prune outdated notes quarterly.

### [sanand0/prompts](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts)

_The prompt collection stayed active enough to keep examples fresh for experiments._

- **Curated prompt edits:** Pushes to live on 23 Oct 2025 updated prompt files. Browse recent commits at [commits/live](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts/commits/live). These sharpen examples for reuse. Takeaway: keep prompts executable and short.
- **Example improvements:** Files like [afterslides.md](https://github.com/sanand0/prompts/blob/live/afterslides.md) likely saw tweaks. Better examples reduce setup friction. Takeaway: real prompts beat abstract guidance.
- **Branch housekeeping:** Small branch activity ensures the collection stays synced with experiments. Takeaway: version example prompts like code.

### [sanand0/talks](https://github.com/sanand0/talks)

_Slides and talk pages received updates so recordings and notes align with event pages._

- **Schedule and assets updates:** Pushes to main on 24 Oct 2025 refreshed talk pages. See [commits/main](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/commits/main). This keeps event pages accurate. Takeaway: sync slides, video links, and pages after each talk.
- **Small content fixes:** Likely edits to talk metadata or links. Check repo index files. Takeaway: broken links erode audience trust faster than typos.
- **Aside:** Yes, you do need the extra speaker note. Takeaway: keep a canonical talk folder for each event.

### [sanand0/aipipe](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe)

_Aipipe had a brief round of commits to keep the proxy and docs in good shape._

- **Minor pushes:** Commits to main on 19 Oct 2025 refreshed code or docs. See [commits/main](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe/commits/main). These maintain the proxy and admin docs. Takeaway: keep security and deployment docs current.
- **Docs and deploy hints:** The README describes deployment steps; small edits likely clarified secrets or tests. Link: [README.md](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe/blob/main/README.md). Takeaway: clear deploy docs reduce time-to-prod.
- **Practical note:** Confirm secrets aren’t accidentally committed. Takeaway: audit commits for leaked env vars after edits.

### [sanand0/voronoi-treemap-test](https://github.com/sanand0/voronoi-treemap-test)

_You created a playground branch to experiment with Voronoi treemaps and integrations._

- **Branch created:** New branch main was created on 21 Oct 2025. See the branch: [tree/main](https://github.com/sanand0/voronoi-treemap-test/tree/main). This sets up a sandbox. Takeaway: isolate experiments to avoid repo drift.
- **Experiment-first layout:** This repo likely holds minimal demo code to test treemap ideas. Link to the repo root. Takeaway: a small dedicated test repo speeds iteration.
- **Wry aside:** Yes, more Voronoi tests are justified. Takeaway: fail fast in a throwaway repo.

### [sanand0/d3-weighted-voronoi](https://github.com/sanand0/d3-weighted-voronoi)

_Forked upstream to experiment and adapt the weighted Voronoi plugin for personal use._

- **Forked for experiments:** Fork event occurred on 21 Oct 2025. Repo: [d3-weighted-voronoi](https://github.com/sanand0/d3-weighted-voronoi). This lets you push local tweaks. Takeaway: fork before you tinker with library internals.
- **Local changes expected:** Use the fork to try treemap-tweaks and plotting fixes. Link to upstream docs in README. Takeaway: keep PRs small if upstream contributions are intended.
- **Aside:** This is the “dangerously fun” repo. Takeaway: pin test cases to avoid regressions.

### [sanand0/llmpagestest](https://github.com/sanand0/llmpagestest)

_This test repo stayed idle this week, but it’s still useful as a sandbox for page experiments._

- **No commits this week:** No recorded pushes in the period. Repo: [llmpagestest](https://github.com/sanand0/llmpagestest). Use it for safe experiments. Takeaway: reserve a playground repo for noisy tests.
- **Prep for future experiments:** Ensure README documents the experiment steps. Takeaway: a short README saves future you a head-scratch.
- **Mini-ops reminder:** Add CI or a cleanup cron to avoid stale branches. Takeaway: automate routine housekeeping.

## Lessons

- Small, frequent commits win. They reduce merge friction and keep deploys predictable.
- Keep docs and deploy steps updated when you touch infra. Human memory is the real technical debt.
- Use forks and sandbox repos for risky experiments. They protect main projects.
- Automate site builds and tests for content-heavy repos. It prevents stale pages.
- Tagging and short notes scale discoverability for long-running journals.

## Suggestions

- Add basic CI checks for scripts and datastories (lint, build) to catch breakages earlier.
- For aipipe, run a quick secret-scan across recent commits to avoid accidental leaks.
- In d3-weighted-voronoi fork, add a minimal test-case and CI to guard algorithm changes.
- Consolidate deployment steps into one script per repo to enable 1-command deploys.
- Schedule a weekly small-review session: close stale branches, update READMEs, and merge tiny fixes.
