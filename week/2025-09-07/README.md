## A Week of Smarter LLM Tools, Robust Evaluations, and Data Gen UI Polish

This week teaches us that careful API design, security fixes, and UI clarity together make developer tools shine. From safer token handling to mind maps for PDF uploads, the updates refine the developer experience top to bottom.

### [sanand0/mindgen](https://github.com/sanand0/mindgen)

_MindGen’s enhancements make knowledge graph creation more flexible by adding PDF upload support and favoring stable LLM choices for better user control and clarity._

- **Add PDF Uploads:** Users can now upload PDFs for automatic knowledge graph creation ([1af01ec](https://github.com/sanand0/mindgen/commit/1af01ec724baf27c1cd18e92c1f0f261eac016e6), 03 Sep 2025). This lets the app handle more document types, opening possibilities beyond text files. Takeaway: Meeting users where their data lives broadens app utility.
- **Switch to Safer Text Rendering:** Changed node text insertion from `.text()` to `.html()` ([1af01ec](https://github.com/sanand0/mindgen/commit/1af01ec724baf27c1cd18e92c1f0f261eac016e6)). This supports richer formatting inside nodes but requires trust or sanitization. Takeaway: Always balance display richness with security.
- **Default to GPT 4.1 Mini Model:** Adjusted default LLM model to `gpt-4.1-mini` for balanced cost and quality ([6370325](https://github.com/sanand0/mindgen/commit/637032556fcb1cc2e1a6f65471327d4b5fe0365f), 03 Sep 2025). Lower default cost with solid performance helps users get started affordably. Takeaway: Pick sensible defaults for smooth onboarding.
- **License and Doc Cleanup:** Streamlined README and replaced the favicon with an embedded SVG ([97dd46d](https://github.com/sanand0/mindgen/commit/97dd46df35cc303565a5539391abcf85b541fa8d), 06 Sep 2025). Minor UX refinements polish the user impression. Takeaway: Small polish matters, even on doc and branding fronts.

Yes, MindGen finally admits PDFs aren’t just for invoices.

### [sanand0/tds-evals](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals)

_Strong evaluation tools grew this week with robust error handling, progressive testing, and clearer user instructions—crucial for grading LLM projects fairly and reliably._

- **Robust Error Reporting in Evaluations:** Enhanced `eval.py` to log multiple detailed reasons on failed LLM outputs (invalid JSON, wrong structure, numeric issues) and allow retrying ([6c24898](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals/commit/6c248986c20f8cc287d6760e8f0b73afcd6e2e4e), 06 Sep 2025). Improved transparency helps debug flaky LLM responses. Takeaway: In complex automated evals, verbose errors aid trust and troubleshooting.
- **Standardize Project Metadata and Deps:** Added `pyproject.toml` for centralized config and dependencies (`httpx`, `typer`, `tqdm`, `pytest`), plus locked versions in `uv.lock` ([6c24898](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals/commit/6c248986c20f8cc287d6760e8f0b73afcd6e2e4e)). This improves reproducible installs and testing flow. Takeaway: Even nimble scripts benefit from explicit dependency pinning.
- **Consolidate Scoring Logic:** Removed old summary CSV script in favor of simpler integration inside `score.py` ([6c24898](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals/commit/6c248986c20f8cc287d6760e8f0b73afcd6e2e4e)). Scores gracefully handle missing or non-numeric values, cleaning up CSV output. Takeaway: Keep aggregation code DRY for easier maintenance.
- **Mandate OPENAI_API_KEY:** Fail early if API key is missing for evaluation runs. Updated docs & tests reflect this requirement ([6c24898](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals/commit/6c248986c20f8cc287d6760e8f0b73afcd6e2e4e)). Prevents silent failures in CI or local runs. Takeaway: Validate critical env vars as early as possible.
- **Improve Fetching Relevance:** Treat zero-length downloaded repo text files as missing and trigger re-fetch; log detailed failure reasons with timestamps ([6c24898](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals/commit/6c248986c20f8cc287d6760e8f0b73afcd6e2e4e)). Better fidelity in data ingestion avoids confusing empty inputs. Takeaway: Detect empty-but-present files explicitly when syncing remote data.
- **Use `tqdm` Progress Bars:** Add live progress bars during repo fetching and evaluation ([6c24898](https://github.com/sanand0/tds-evals/commit/6c248986c20f8cc287d6760e8f0b73afcd6e2e4e)). Smooth UI feedback encourages patience. Takeaway: Real-time progress boosts user confidence for long-running ops.

Robustness is key because LLM-based grading isn’t that reliable on first try. Retry, log details, stay sane.

### [Nitin399-maker/datagen](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/datagen)

_DataGen now sports a cleaner UI and easier user control, along with externalized configuration for demo datasets._

This declutters the interface and allows custom prompts on demand. Takeaway: Hide complexity until users want it.
- **Externalize Demo Cards into `config.json`:** Refactored demo scenarios out of code into a `config.json` file loaded dynamically, simplifying maintenance ([69f8c21](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/datagen/commit/69f8c216c6b72283481358e719a5013b81949e71)). Enables extensibility without touching JavaScript. Takeaway: Config over code equals non-developers updating demos.
- **Improve Generate Button Feedback:** Added spinner and disabled state on generation click to show clear processing state ([69f8c21](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/datagen/commit/69f8c216c6b72283481358e719a5013b81949e71)). This reduces duplicate clicks and user confusion. Takeaway: Don’t leave users guessing if something’s working.
- **Modify Demo Card Behavior:** Clicking cards now scrolls the generate button into view instead of auto-submitting, giving users chance to tweak prompts ([69f8c21](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/datagen/commit/69f8c216c6b72283481358e719a5013b81949e71)). Subtle but important UX upgrade. Takeaway: Never assume users want instant execution on demos.
- **Remove `utils.js`:** With demos and prompts moved out, the unused `utils.js` script was deleted, reducing code clutter ([69f8c21](https://github.com/Nitin399-maker/datagen/commit/69f8c216c6b72283481358e719a5013b81949e71)). Takeaway: Trim dead weight early.

Who needs another data gen tool? Well, one with spinner love and a neat accordion.

### [sanand0/aipipe](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe)

_Security took center stage with fixes to prevent open redirects plus UI code refactor for clearer usage stats._
